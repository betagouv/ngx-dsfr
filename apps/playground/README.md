# Playground

The `playground` app enables you to get documentation and interact
directly with the Components already available in the 
`ngx-dsfr` library.

## How to launch the playground app ?

1. Clone this MonoRepo on your computer or pull to get an up-to-date version
2. Install all dependencies at their newest version with NPM or YARN, for instance
3. Tap this in your Terminal, _while being at the MonoRepo's root_:
 ```shell
 nx serve playground
 ```
4. Then open this URL in your browser : `http://localhost:4200` ( _the port might vary but it will be indicated in the output 
from the previous command_ )
